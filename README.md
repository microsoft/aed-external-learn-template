# Learn Template

This repo is designed to help you create and scaffold your Student/Step 0 content for Microsoft Learn.

If you've found this repo, but haven't yet:

1. Read our [Student/Step 0 content strategy doc](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/shanama_microsoft_com1/EWcQMH7tyKNNstzafKABeTwB7TVKhOm5AUoWcBjIvwA3kg?e=zXatFa)
1. Reached out to Shana Matthews (shanama) 

Please take those steps before starting on your content creation journey.

## Requirements

Talk about the general process:
- Do your research:
    - Does this content already exist? What are you bringing new?
    - Will this work on a student account? (not a deal breaker if not, but would be nice)
    - Will this work on Mac and PC? How about browser (with CodeSpaces)?
- Propose to Shana üíç with [these instructions](./module-proposal.md)
- Decide on a timeline for project completion
- Decide what you're building (module, lp) 
- Outline it using [this module design template](./module-design-template.md) and share with Shana to ensure it is the right size and format
- Review the [Learn content requirements](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/content-requirements?branch=master)
- Clone this template repo
- Write your content
- Work with Shana to fill in the yml files
- Get someone to review it 
- Deliver the repo to Shana 
- Respond to PR/DevOps requests from Aquent in the Learn repo
- Review the content once it's live
- Participate in a monthly bug bash (if necessary for your content, Shana will let you know)

# Module

So you want to write a module on it's own or part of a learning path, great! 

## Files

- Module Folder:
    - index.yml: Contains the outline of hte content and the actual titles, descriptions, etc
    - unit.yml (for each unit): Contains the outline of hte content and the actual titles, descriptions, etc
        - Each module should have an introduction.yml and summary.yml file
    - summary.yml: Additionally contains the knowledge check questions (see below)
    - Media Folder
        - README.md: Table containing the file, URL, Date Accesses, and Copyright information if taken from the web for an easy legal review if necessary
        - All images/media to be used throughout the module
    - Includes Folder
        - unit.md (for each unit): Contains the actual content for each unit
        - Each module should have an introduction.md and summary.md file

## Knowledge Checks

All modules are **required** to either have at least one knowledge check or at least one hands-on exercise unit that uses the sandbox in some way. Having both is better.

We recommend having at least one knowledge check per module, even if you do have hands-on exercises that use the sandbox. Knowledge checks are:
- Multiple choice (no True/False)
- Don't have "All/None of the above" as an option
- Should actually contribute to learning
- Need to have the correct answer indicated
- Need to have explanations for why each answer is either correct or incorrect

Knowledge checks can be embedded in a unit or a standalone unit. If embedded, knowledge checks should be 2-3 questions. If standalone, they must be the second-to-last unit in a module and must be 3-5 questions. They should not be combined with the Summary unit, instead they should come right before.

# Learning Path

So you decided to build a Learning Path for your Modules! Awesome!

## Files

Learning paths are defined by a single index.yml file. 

LP Folder
  - README.md: Contains the LP title and the Module Titles for quick reference
  - index.yml: Contains the outline of the Modules within the Learning Path and the actual titles, descriptions, etc

# Getting Started

If you are going to build a module on it's own, we recommend starting from the module-1 folder and deleteing the learning-path-1 folder from your repo. Copy the module-1 folder for each module you want to create.

If you are going to build modules as part of a learning path, copy the lp1-module-1 folder for each module you want to create and the learning-path-1 folder for each learning path you want to create. Module folders do not live within a Learning Path's folder structure.

Don't Forget:
- Rename folders and files to match YOUR content. 
- Change the contents of this README to only have the following:
