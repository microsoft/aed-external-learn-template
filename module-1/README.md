## Knowledge checks

All modules are required to either have at least one knowledge check or at least one hands-on exercise unit that uses the sandbox in some way. Having both is better.

We recommend having at least one knowledge check, even if you do have hands-on exercises that use the sandbox. Knowledge checks are:

- Multiple choice (no True/False)
- Don't have "All/None of the above" as an option
- Should actually contribute to learning
- Need to have the correct answer indicated
- Need to have explanations for why each answer is either correct or incorrect

Knowledge checks can be embedded in a unit or exist as a standalone unit. 

- If embedded, knowledge checks should be 2-3 questions. 
- If standalone, they must be the second-to-last unit in a module and must be 3-5 questions. They should not be combined with the Summary unit, instead they should be their own unit right before. 

Knowledge checks live inline in a unit's .yml file. It can be tedious to put them in with the correct syntax so if you'd like, you can instead put them in the unit's .md file in a reasonable format and we will translate them. Standalone knowledge check units won't have (don't need) a .md file, but you can put a dummy .md file in as a placeholder to keep consistent.
